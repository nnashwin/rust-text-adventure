# Outline
Main mystery in the story: Albert ended the world.  But Thomas left a way to rebuild.

Reason the character wants to find out all of the details: There is promise of a treasure "to light of the world"  in the ruin.  In this post apocalyptic world, "ruin running" is one of the main methods that people find technology to salvage and use to survive.

Your character doesn't know too much about the ruins, but he/she does know that the ruins represent survival.  You happen upon this ruin after a wall collapses in a smaller ruin that many people have entered before.  This proves promising and potentially full of treasure.

## Story Notes
A wind blows over the dunes of sand that cover the known world as you step up to a large dilapidated building.

Unlike other ruins you have seen in the past, this structure does not speak of a lavish past.

You are greeted with a metal door weathered from the years and bearing a strange insignia.
