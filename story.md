# Outline
Main mystery in the story: Albert ended the world.  Thomas was depressed and contemplated ending everyting.  Ultimately, he left a way to rebuild.

Reason the character wants to find out all of the details: There is promise of a treasure "to light of the world"  in the ruin.  In this post apocalyptic world, "ruin running" is one of the main methods that people find technology to salvage and use to survive.

Your character doesn't know too much about the ruins, but he/she does know that the ruins represent survival.  You happen upon this ruin after a wall collapses in a smaller ruin that many people have entered before.  This proves promising and potentially full of treasure. 

## Backstory (Maybe can be intro)
The Year is 2XXX.  The governments and world powers of old have gone.  During the Great War many people died and cities were destroyed.
Only those of us who banded together and formed tribes and small villages in the wilderness remain.

It's said your grandparents were one of the first to leave your village in the Catskills (think of name) mountains and take the long road to scout the ruins. They returned with wonders that has allowed the village to build and made life close to what it once was.

Since their pilgrimage, many people in the village have made the trek to Robot City (think of name).

You find yourself in a familiar building you have been in every year since you can remember coming to the ruins.

As you were making to head back to the village, you stumbled and fell into a wall covered in dirt that had been made weak by termites chewing through the wood long ago.

The wall gave way and crumbled to the floor. You notice a steel door directly ahead of you with an odd insignia carved into the metal.

## Random Ideas
1. Let the Helmet send the player back into Thomas's dream world.  In the dream world, the player is transported to Thomas's memories and sees glimpses and scenes of the past.
1. The first dream world will happen underground in Thomas's laboratory. When you take the elevator down, you are greeted with a giant room that contains a large, intact table that looks as if it could be
an operating bed, a giant multi-tool; that is attached to the ceiling, and a large mainframe computer situated next to the wall.
1. The room will ultimately have a secret exit that you can find after transporting into the different world from the past. 
1. Don't make a dialogue system in the game, but in the past world's that you can visit, enable Thomas to pick up specific items to advance the story.
1. The Helmet should be located in Thomas's Bedroom.
-- It could have a name on the back to signify the importance.
-- Thomas's bedroom is dissheveled, covered in clothes.
1. The child's bedroom should have a secret room that needs to be unlocked to view.
1. Puzzle in the Child's bedroom that unlocks the blaster somehow.

## Story Notes
A wind blows over the dunes of sand that cover the known world as you step up to a large dilapidated building.

Unlike other ruins you have seen in the past, this structure does not speak of a lavish past.

You are greeted with a metal door weathered from the years and bearing a strange insignia.

Insert Megaman or Dr. L ascii art.
